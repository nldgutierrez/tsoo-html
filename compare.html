                <h3>Obsidian vs Notion</h3>
            </header>
            <p>
                Notion and Obsidian are two of the most popular note-taking apps available today. Each software offers a unique set of features depending on the needs of individual users or teams.
            </p>
            <p>
                If you are looking for a centralized hub for sharing files, folders, and documents with your team members across various devices then Notion is an ideal note-taking solution for you. Notion allows you to share your workstation, which makes it suitable for working on projects as a team.
            </p>
            <p>
                Obsidian is the right note-taking tool if you are looking for simple, straightforward software that allows you to take your notes without any distractions. Obsidian purely works offline and keeps your data confidential as it saves all your data on your device and not on cloud storage. It is best for notes taking while researching since it allows backlinking.

                <h3>Obsidian vs Evernote</h3>
            </header>
            <p>
                Evernote has been the king of note-taking apps for over a decade. It is no wonder as 200 million people use Evernote to take notes, track tasks and organize projects. The app is available on several platforms and has the capability of being synced across devices. However, the company has received its fair share of criticism over the years for raising its prices, gutting the free version, and failing to address significant concerns raised by power users. The high cost of the app turns off many people.
            </p>
            <p>
                Obsidian is a note-taking and knowledge management app created by the same people who made Dynalist. Unless other note-taking apps with Obsidian, you control where your data is stored. Obsidian's data stores your information on your hard drive in a folder of Markdown files. Obsidian allows you to access your notes using any text editor or Markdown app. You can also elect to store your information in the Cloud using iCloud, Google, Drive, GitHub, and more.
            </p>
            <p>
                As you can tell, Obsidian lets you decide where to store your data, and therefore you are ultimately in control of your security. Just be sure to check out how secure your data is if you elect to store your information on the Cloud.
