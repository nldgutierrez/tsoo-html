            <h2>About this project</h2>
            <p>
                Hi! I'm Noelle Gutierrez, currently self-studying Web Development from <a href="https://theodinproject.com/about" target="_blank">The Odin Project</a> and Computer Science from <a href="https://github.com/ossu/computer-science" target="_blank">OSSU</a>, and an aspiring Software Engineer.
            </p>
            <p>
                <em>The Science of Obsidian</em> is a small website project of mine. Its content are primarily ripped off of other sources in the web (see: <a href="./references.html">References</a>) to give me something to work with for its structure.
            </p>
            <p>
                The main objective for this project is to practice my skills in the foundations of web development--specifically, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
            </p>
            <p>
                This website's main topic is <a href="https://obsidian.md" target="_blank">Obsidian</a>, a note-taking software that I discovered recently and am loving more each day. I did not immediately think of this as the topic for the website. In fact, I had an initial list of five (5) different topics and used <a href="https://wheeldecide.com/" target="_blank">Wheel Decide</a> to pick one for me, which is Obsidian.
            </p>

            <p>
                This project is divided into three stages: HTML, HTML+CSS, and HTML+CSS+JavaScript. Pretty self-explanatory, but basically, I would like to create three versions of this website to practice building websites properly. Especially for HTML, I wanted to learn accessibility and semantic HTML right from the start so I could create structure with context and in the future, accessible websites.
            </p>
            <p>
                All stages of this project are available on my <a href="https://github.com/nldgutierrez" target="_blank">GitHub</a> profile.
            </p>

                Should you wish to give any comment, suggestion, or feedback on how I could further improve my skills, please do not hesitate to <a href="./contact.html">send me a message</a>.
            </p>
            <p>
                Have a great day! :)
